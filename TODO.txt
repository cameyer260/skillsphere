- add supabase edge function for syncing new user accounts to the profiles table. current fix for the problem is inserting the profile on sucessful signups in the singup function in actions.ts, but once we add other forms of auth (sign in through google, github, etc.) this fix will not work and we will need a supabase edge function to handle it
- fix signup flow, make it smoother and less clunky
- add on temporary guest account and allow them to play live against friends or any of the games for a limit amount of time (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-anonymous)
- add supabase edge function to rate limit to prevent spam
- maybe just remove favorite games, or add safety that does not allow users to just add whatever they want to it

- lock down the favorite games field on profiles so users cannot enter whatever into it remove it



NEXT TODO IMPORTANT********
- finish friends search method
- make this whole site publicly accessible. delay requiring sign-in/sign-up for as long as possible


- IMMEDIATELY FIX THIS FIRST
- LOCK DOWN FRIENDS ACCEPT/REJECT. MAKE IT SO THAT THE RECEIVER CANNOT ALSO CHANGE THE USERNAMES, AVATARS, ETC OF THE FRIENDSHIP
- FIX ALL THE SHITTING FUNCTIONS YOU MADE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO SYNC THE AVATAR INDEX TO THE FRIENDS TABLE ON CHANGES, THEY ONLY HALF WORK 
- FIX THE SHITTY FRIENDS COUNT SYNC THEY ALSO ONLY HALF WORK
