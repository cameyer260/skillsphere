- add supabase edge function to rate limit to prevent spam
- maybe just remove favorite games, or add safety that does not allow users to just add whatever they want to it
- FIX THE ISSUE WHERE WHEN YOU ADD A NEW FRIEND ON THE ACCOUNT PAGE THEY DISSAPPEAR FROM THE SEARCH RESULTS. ALSO EDIT IT SO THAT THE STATUS OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP SHOWS NEXT TO THEM, LIKE IF YOU HAVE THEM ADDED AND STATUS IS PENDING ITLL SHOW PENDING, OR IF THEY ADDED YOU YOU CAN ACCEPT OR REJECT FROM THERE. JUST POLISH ALL THAT STUFF UP SO IT WORKS BETTER.
- make this whole site publicly accessible. delay requiring sign-in/sign-up for as long as possible
- finish friends search method

- IMMEDIATELY FIX THIS FIRST*****************
- continue working on page.tsx. handle disconnect/kick gracefully.
- try to make the online page.tsx page for tic tac toe a global page that can be used for the other games like the lobby component
- then do one of these two:
1. add some more simple turn based games to have online play, they do not need local versions but can have them too if it works for the select game 
2. create a universal lobby page that can be used for any game. have it take a game name param that it can inject into the lobby title. then the online page for the select game will handle connecting to the web socket on the right game and so on and so forth.
