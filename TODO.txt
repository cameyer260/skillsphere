- add supabase edge function to rate limit to prevent spam
- maybe just remove favorite games, or add safety that does not allow users to just add whatever they want to it
- FIX THE ISSUE WHERE WHEN YOU ADD A NEW FRIEND ON THE ACCOUNT PAGE THEY DISSAPPEAR FROM THE SEARCH RESULTS. ALSO EDIT IT SO THAT THE STATUS OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP SHOWS NEXT TO THEM, LIKE IF YOU HAVE THEM ADDED AND STATUS IS PENDING ITLL SHOW PENDING, OR IF THEY ADDED YOU YOU CAN ACCEPT OR REJECT FROM THERE. JUST POLISH ALL THAT STUFF UP SO IT WORKS BETTER.
- make this whole site publicly accessible. delay requiring sign-in/sign-up for as long as possible
- finish friends search method

- IMMEDIATELY FIX THIS FIRST*****************
- make tic tac toe online page and lobby component both universal for all games. just take in params for what game it is.
- then do one of these two:
1. add some more simple turn based games to have online play, they do not need local versions but can have them too if it works for the select game
