- add supabase edge function for syncing new user accounts to the profiles table. current fix for the problem is inserting the profile on sucessful signups in the singup function in actions.ts, but once we add other forms of auth (sign in through google, github, etc.) this fix will not work and we will need a supabase edge function to handle it
- edit friendships table so that there can be no duplicate pairs (same requester and receiever in any order)******
- get friends figures out on account page first
- fix signup flow, make it smoother and less clunky
- add on temporary guest account and allow them to play live against friends or any of the games for a limit amount of time (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-anonymous)
