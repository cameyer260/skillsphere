- add supabase edge function for syncing new user accounts to the profiles table. current fix for the problem is inserting the profile on sucessful signups in the singup function in actions.ts, but once we add other forms of auth (sign in through google, github, etc.) this fix will not work and we will need a supabase edge function to handle it
- fix signup flow, make it smoother and less clunky
- add on temporary guest account and allow them to play live against friends or any of the games for a limit amount of time (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-anonymous)
- add supabase edge function to rate limit to prevent spam
- maybe just remove favorite games, or add safety that does not allow users to just add whatever they want to it



NEXT TODO IMPORTANT********
- finish friends search method
- make this whole site publicly accessible. delay requiring sign-in/sign-up for as long as possible


- IMMEDIATELY FIX THIS FIRST*****************
- AFTER THAT, INVESTIGATE EVANS ISSUE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A SUPABASE SESSION. DELETE THE ALT ACCOUNT USER AND USE IT TO SIGN UP TO SEE IF IT IS AN ISSUE ON THIS DEVICE. TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE AUTH FLOW BETTER

- FIX THE ISSUE WHERE WHEN YOU ADD A NEW FRIEND ON THE ACCOUNT PAGE THEY DISSAPPEAR FROM THE SEARCH RESULTS. ALSO EDIT IT SO THAT THE STATUS OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP SHOWS NEXT TO THEM, LIKE IF YOU HAVE THEM ADDED AND STATUS IS PENDING ITLL SHOW PENDING, OR IF THEY ADDED YOU YOU CAN ACCEPT OR REJECT FROM THERE. JUST POLISH ALL THAT STUFF UP SO IT WORKS BETTER.
