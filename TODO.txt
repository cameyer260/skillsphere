- add supabase edge function for syncing new user accounts to the profiles table. current fix for the problem is inserting the profile on sucessful signups in the singup function in actions.ts, but once we add other forms of auth (sign in through google, github, etc.) this fix will not work and we will need a supabase edge function to handle it
- fix signup flow, make it smoother and less clunky
- add on temporary guest account and allow them to play live against friends or any of the games for a limit amount of time (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-anonymous)
- add supabase edge function to rate limit to prevent spam




NEXT TODO IMPORTANT********
- finish friends search method
- make this whole site publicly accessible. delay requiring sign-in/sign-up for as long as possible


- FOR PROFILE PAGE DO THIS NEXT
- add a joined at and friends count column to profiles, properly display them on frontend
- if the user tries to visit their own page, just redirect them to the account page
- add an add friend button if you are not already friends, add other polishing details
